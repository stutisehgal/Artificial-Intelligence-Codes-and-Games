# Algorithm:

● First, create a list of all the characters that need assigning to pass to solve.
● If all characters are assigned, return true if the puzzle is solved, false otherwise.
● Otherwise, consider the first unassigned character for (every possible choice among the digits
not in use) make that choice and then if recursion successful, return true
● If not successful, unmake assignment and try another digit wise try to assign the rest of the
characters.
● If all digits have been tried and nothing worked, return false.
