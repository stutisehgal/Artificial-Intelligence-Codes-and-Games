# ALGORITHM:

1. We have to take input of a tree, as a matrix.
2. We have to visit each node. Now we have to so like layer wise, starting at the root node
followed by all child nodes.
3. Once all child nodes of the root node are visited, we further have to go to the child node of
child nodes and so on.
4. For every node visited, add it to a list in state space.
