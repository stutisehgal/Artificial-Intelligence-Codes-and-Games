# Algorithm 

minimax(state, depth, player)

if (player = max) then
best = [null, -infinity]
else
best = [null, +infinity]

if (depth = 0 or gameover) then
score = evaluate this state for player
return [null, score]

for each valid move m for player in state s do
execute move m on s
[move, score] = minimax(s, depth - 1, -player)
undo move m on s

if (player = max) then
if score > best.score then best = [move, score]
else
if score < best.score then best = [move, score]

return best
