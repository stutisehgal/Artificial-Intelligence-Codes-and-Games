# ALGORITHM:

o Step 1: SET STATUS = 1 (ready state) for each node in G
o Step 2: Push the starting node on the stack and set its Status as waiting state
o Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until stack is empty
o Step 4: Pop the top node N. Process it and set its Status as processed state
o Step 5: Push on the stack all the neighbours of N that are in the ready state (whose status is ready and set it as waiting state)
